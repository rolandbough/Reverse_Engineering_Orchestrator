# Documentation

This directory contains architecture decision records (ADRs) and agent directives for the Reverse Engineering Orchestrator project.

## Structure

- `agent.md` - Main directive for AI agents working on this project
- `ADR-*.md` - Architecture Decision Records documenting key decisions

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows a standard format:
- **Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Rejected | Deprecated | Superseded
- **Date:** When the decision was made
- **Deciders:** Who made the decision
- **Context:** Background and problem statement
- **Decision:** What was decided
- **Consequences:** Positive, negative, and risks
- **Implementation Notes:** How to implement

## Reading ADRs

ADRs are numbered sequentially and should be read in order to understand the evolution of the project's architecture. Each ADR documents:
- Questions asked and answers received
- Rationale for technical choices
- Trade-offs considered
- Context that may not be obvious from code alone

## Contributing

When making significant architectural decisions:
1. Create a new ADR following the template
2. Document questions asked and answers
3. Explain rationale and alternatives considered
4. Update this README if needed
